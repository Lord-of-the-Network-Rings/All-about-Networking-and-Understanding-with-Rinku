Networking and understanding Network relation Between modules, rearrange, decodation, Intercept between device and Communication signals. Article for networking Sectors . finding Gaps\Loop_holes .

Well, 

Seriously! I wrote this Article thinking of a Weed. 
I'm now smiling on my own thought. Why i posted it to blogs and Sent it to Forbes and
University like Harvard! 😅

Pardon my silliness. 
    $ Pardon My Humour... . $


I was trying to fix a Custom Android App to modify internet Usages. 
Meanwhile i was speed testing on my Android Device using some third party or built in App. or may be, i discovered this while thinking about make nano Cercuit and IC building for signal manupulation 😄 .  sshhoooo...!

Our Android handsets are besically a Linux base core operating system.  Its is running on some Framework. Android system actually a Framework as we know.  (Technically)
Android system actually Runs some special Rules to Emulate, yes i repeat Emulate so called apps.  
So our Android Framework actually adopts some kind of way to run/emulate all kind of language with proper element (java, php, html, html5, angular js, any bootstrups u wanna use.  

Let go to main thing im excited to write it down :---
I Used
	$ A external Application downloaded from Google Play Store $

The Play store Free APP was for testing general internet speed between my
All the network Capacity from netwok broad to sim to handset_mainboard. 

	$ {[( (Network Broadcasting Tower to SIM Card IC).  < [sim card TO HANSET NETWORK IC] then < {Network IC to < my mainboard processor IC}  )]} . $ 
So using the app i seen from 'request' - the app made a command from direct operating system shell to print out put or show user a Result. 
	$ To print output / display something to me on screen. (Affer calculating a command then process it throw Processor by bits . $

The App checked Something Interesting before output;  which is "data speed of sim operator to broadcasted Tower frequency about data outgoing/receiving capacity directly from Tower to my sim card IC and show us interpreted . 
Then it checks my Sim IC to my main board IC's  network connectivity and power capacity. 

'Handset' is mainly a combination verius module in Single 'mother_board'
	$ mother_board / main board is ' = ' && sister_board ' = '  &  ' ≠ ' of a Mother_board or Single_board ,  module_board combination in single board ' = ' mother_board . $ 

So, the combination of  Multiple Sister_board =/< in a Single Main_board. 

Why a Mother_board can be combination of verious boards in a single Space / Board?
With the help of intigrated IC and logic-Gates with mathematical Calculation of electricity supply inside the main board and it's Connectivity ; we can get exact output we Desire to see 🤩. 
But Adventure really doesn't ENDS here....


Other example about main_board : 

Mother_Board is a place of multiple complete module's place of paradise in short space. Actually the purpose of my Article is to make thing go on.. Or help our Upcoming generating evolve more advance than we are now.
As we understand    $'main board' and 'mother board'$
	$ All boards are = or ≠ same thing but could be some combination of multiple board in one single place(space). $


😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫  -  😵😵😵  :::: i think my Elastic_heart article is longer than any other Usual Articles. 

I am making things long and boring for understand in Future,  about - Network and relation Between hardwire and firmware.
	$ " what is Network  &&  Network Between sim IC to handset IC; Checking connectivity . " $

Now,  lets try Focus on my android app;  im trying to Monitoring commands and Traffic packages. . 
First the App checked capacity of my Sim card data capture speed and my main_board data capture speed along with data capacity limit	$ (the electricity) $ . 
	$ {Android Sub System Linux [Emulated (Electricity Supply)]}.  $


	$ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~😁😄😀~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ $

Bro, is crazy! 
	$ Networking is wird !... .  $

After all,
Handset board capacity is combined with 5G Tech now day but we still have majority of devices with vast amount of users community uses some old GEN Tech Device with Old gen network IC capacity.
 about 811 MBPS which is too high to resist from short cercuit and Being tiny. 
If we try to use it's full potential (or overclocing) it may cause some Disaster. But we are human.  
We always Push the limit as we Evolving, Learning new things everday. 


Ok,
So
	$ our device manufacturers technically lie but its not a lie at all $ 

Because if we make a proper Calculated Cercuit syatem with IC, Proper circuit board resistors and Capacitors we can bite the Fortune now.
	$ {[for servive or resist longer than] < real time ] || (example: minimum 1 years maximum 10-20 years)]} $

But Economy and Capitalism and internet Business System, food chain is real Enemy of Frelance Researchers like us. but we keep
Studing for time pass 😄 or grooming our brain. 
	$ Keep Learning < post More what you thinking $ 

Yap we already have all the futuristic tech available on planet. They are already exists. 
But theocratical, the technologycal limitation and Security barier are the main reason our system/society dosent allow much privilege or access to knowing much about deep Networking. 
'Core Networking' Practical analysis are less privilized for front-end users along with font-end developers ; it is only to Prevent damage on Online Financial & Business Sectors 🧐 . 

The next :-
	$ Possible existing technology $
Using super conductive mother_board cpasitor or IC,  
We can build a super handset or a Computing_Machine at present day. Which will be far more advanced and Futuristic to current general users on the Globe . 
Practically the combination of proper Cercuitry, Capable of doing anything . 
Observing Networking between everything would be so fascinating on these Advance Gadgates, It's fast and highly resistance on_board .  

From the Begining of our Technological Time,
Our challange is to making some powerful resistor, switching circuitry in a very tinny place. 
I mean, making a IC ir Circuit syatem As Tinny as We Can. 
And we are continuously make it inside in very very little place like - nano centimetres space.
	$ = / ≠ .  $
Or In public language_  i can say, a tinny chip in a mobile_cercuit_board at a very short space. which is resistend from short_cercuit proof with wires (tinny cables) during Power Circulation.  
All though we have now PCI board like technology which is also Amezing and There is still a lot-lot-lot to discover yet.
	$ " Alas ! It is nothing if u dont know everything @_@  🤪 " . $ 

But making things tinny is not enough till untill infinity which is not discovered yet (+)(-) = (-)  [Don't fall in Paradox] ........

	$ { I didn't wanted to disappoint you guys 😞 . But everything is possible ♤ } . be evolved  $


So i guess this content is not that improper for modern day's hackers but a true shinny inspiration for modern day's 'Dremers-Developer' Family like us.
Best Wishes from 'True Developers Family'. 

	$ Hell Ya to The Royal Devepolers Society..... . $

For hacker like Network Engineers; Isn't the 'Everything Hacking' just a piece of cake?
