Networking and understanding Network relation Between modules, rearrange, decodation, Intercept between device and Communication signals. Article about all networking Sectors . finding Gaps\Loop_holes, Hacking, playing with Network, Intercept in Networking Universe. 

Well, 

Seriously! I wrote this Article thinking of a Weed. 
I'm now smiling on my own thought. Why i posted it to blogs and Sent it to Forbes and
University like Harvard! 😅


Official title : 
	$ Treasures of networking Multiverse . $
My Article Title Number 10.

Pardon my sillyness . 
	$ Pardon My Humour... .  $

I was trying to fix a Custom Android App to modify internet Usages. 
Meanwhile i was speed testing on my Android Device using some third party or built in App. or may be, i discovered this while thinking about make nano Cercuit and IC building for signal manupulation 😄 .  sshhoooo...!

Our Android handsets are besically a Linux base core operating system.  Its is running on some Framework. Android system actually a Framework as we know.  (Technically)
Android system actually Runs some special Rules to Emulate, yes i repeat Emulate so called apps.  
So our Android Framework actually adopts some kind of way to run/emulate all kind of language with proper element (java, php, html, html5, angular js, any bootstrups u wanna use.  

Let go to main thing im excited to write it down :---
I Used :
	$ A external Application downloaded from Google Play Store $
The Play store Free APP was for testing general internet speed between my
All the network Capacity from netwok broad to sim to handset_mainboard .
	$ {[( (Network Broadcasting Tower to SIM Card IC).  < [sim card TO HANSET NETWORK IC] then < {Network IC to < my mainboard processor IC}  )]} . $
So using the app i seen from 'request' - the app made a command from direct operating system shell to print out put or show user a Result .
	$ To print output / display something to me on screen. (Affer calculating a command then process it throw Processor by bits or Binary . $
The App checked Something Interesting before output;  which is "data speed of sim operator to broadcasted Tower networking DB,RSS, Feeds, frequency and all outgoing/receiving capacity directly from Tower to my sim card IC and show us output print_result on display module by interpreted as Human language for Understanding.  
Then it checks my Sim IC to my main board IC's  network connectivity and power capacity. Isn't the App dev brilliant ? 
'Handset' is mainly a combination verius module in Single 'mother_board' / 'main board' / 'sjngle_main_board' .
	$ mother_board / main board is ' = ' && sister_board ' = '  &  ' ≠ '  and 'single_Mother_board' or Single_board is same output Logic || 'module_board' combination in single board ' = ' mother/main_board . $ 
So, the combination of  Multiple Sister_board =/< or =/> in a Single Main_board. 

Why a Mother_board can be combination of verious boards in a single Space / Board?
With the help of integrated IC and logic-Gates with Mathematically Calculation of electricity supply, inside the main board and wire's are basically "Network Connectivity link/wires/cables  ; 
Theoritically, we can get any exact output we Desire to see 🤩. (Depending on module capasity)

But Adventure of Networking really doesn't ENDS here....



Other example about main_board :
Mother_Board is a place of multiple complete module's place of paradise in short space. Actually the purpose of my Article is to make thing go on.. Or help our Upcoming generating evolve more advance than we are now.
As we know 'main board' and 'mother board' are same element.  And for recognition we used a ( _ )[underscore] as it is local root hardwire name or ; command memory soft record module or ; db/record of firmware ; or soft module memory records. 



😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫  -  😵😵😵  :::: i think my Elastic_heart article is longer than any other Usual Articles.
May be my EX still thinks how could be a person so Immature ... 


Well,
I am making things long and boring for understand in Future,  about - Network and relation Between hardwire and firmware.
	$ "what is Network  &&  Network Between sim IC to handset IC; Checking connectivity . "$
Now,  lets try Focus on my android app;  im trying to Monitoring commands and Traffic packages.
First the App checked capacity of my Sim card data capture speed and my main_board data capture speed along with data capacity limit (the electricity) . 
	$ {Android Sub System Linux [Emulated (Electricity Supply)]}.  $
	~~~~~~RAFI~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~😁😄😀~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bro, Networking is crazy ! Im announcing and dedicating my Articles to my Beloved EX as proof of my Data Security. 
Some how on some place womans are right. Its a Miracle bro. I still dont know how a human brain can grow so matured on Subconscious Mode.
I Think im talking stupid now 😄 . 
	$ Networking is wird !... .  $
After all,
Handset board capacity is combined with 5G Tech now day but we still have majority of devices with vast amount of users community uses some old GEN Tech Device with Old gen network IC capacity.
 about 811 MBPS which is too high to resist from short cercuit and Being tiny. 
If we try to use it's full potential (or overclocing) it may cause some Disaster. But we are human.  
We always Push the limit as we Evolving, Learning new things everday. 
Ok,
So, I Decided to dedicate my Article to My EX .
Without her it was impossible for me to understand Newtworking properly. 
	$ our device Manufacturers technically lie but its not a lie at all $
Because if we make a proper Calculated command with proper Architectured Cercuit syatem with IC and circuit board resistors, Capacitors ; We really can bite the Fortune now . 
	$ {[for servive or resist longer than] < real time ] || (example: minimum 1 years maximum 10-20 years)]} $
But Economy along with system of Capitalism and internet Business System, technological food chain are the real Enemy for Freelance Researchers like us. but we keep
Studing for whatever it takes. May be i do study for time pass 😄 or grooming our brain . 
	$ Keep Learning < post More what you thinking and your Ideas $ 
Yap, we already have all the futuristic tech available on planet. They are already exists. 
But theocratical, the technologycal limitation and Security barier are the main reason our system/society dosent allow much privilege or access to knowing much about deep Networking. 
'Core Networking' Practical analysis are less privilized for front-end users along with font-end developers ; it is only to Prevent damage on Online Financial & Business Sectors 🧐 . 
The next : 
	$ Possible existing technology $
Using super conductive mother_board cpasitor or IC,  
We can build a super handset or a Computing_Machine at present day. Which will be far more advanced and Futuristic to current general users on the Globe . 
Practically the combination of proper Cercuitry, Capable of doing anything . 
Observing Networking between everything would be so fascinating on these Advance Gadgates, It's fast and highly resistance on_board .  

From the Begining of our Technological Time,
Our challange is to making some powerful resistor, switching circuitry in a very tinny place. 
I mean, making a IC ir Circuit syatem As Tinny as We Can. 
And we are continuously make it inside in very very little place like - nano centimetres space.
	$ = / ≠ .  $
Or In public language_  i can say, a tinny chip in a mobile_cercuit_board at a very short space. which is resistend from short_cercuit proof with wires (tinny cables) during Power Circulation from power Supply.   
All though we have now PCI board like technology which is also Amezing and There is still a lot-lot-lot to discover yet .
	$ " Alas ! It is nothing for us ; if we dont know everything @_@  🤪 " . $ 
But making things tinny is not enough till untill infinity which is not discovered yet (+)(-) = (-)  [Don't fall in Paradox] ........
	$ { I didn't wanted to disappoint you guys 😞 . But everything is possible ♤ } . be evolved  $
So i guess this content is not that improper for modern day's hackers but a true shinny inspiration for modern day's 'Dremers-Developer' Family like us.
Best Wishes from 'True Developers Family'. 

	$ Hell Ya to The Royal Devepolers Society..... . $

For hacker like Network Engineers; Isn't the 'Everything Hacking' just a piece of cake?
