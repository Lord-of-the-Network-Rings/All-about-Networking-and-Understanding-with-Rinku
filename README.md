Well, 

Seriously! I wrote this Article thinking of a Weed. 
I'm now smiling on my own thought. Why i posted it to blogs and Sent it to Forbes and
University like Harvard! ðŸ˜…

    $Pardon My Humor...$


I was trying to fix a Custom Android App to modify internet Usages. 
Meanwhile i was speed testing on my Android Device using some third party or built in App. or may be, i discovered this while thinking about make nano Cercuit and IC building for signal manupulation ðŸ˜„ .  sshhoooo...!

Our Android handsets are besically a Linux base core operating system.  Its is running on some Framework. Android system actually a Framework as we know.  (Technically)
Android system actually Runs some special Rules to Emulate, yes i repeat Emulate so called apps.  
So our Android Framework actually adopts some kind of way to run/emulate all kind of language with proper element (java, php, html, html5, angular js, any bootstrups u wanna use.  

Let go to main thing im excited to write it down :---

I used a external Application downloaded from Google Play Store app. Is was for test the internet speed between my SIM TO HANSET NETWORK IC  (Sim card IC to my mainboard IC) 


So using the app i seen from request - the app made a command from direct operating system shell 
To print output / display something to me on screen. 

Firat it checked before output which is " data speed of sim operator to broadcasted Tower frequency data receive capacity Tower to my sim card IC. 
Then it checks my Sim IC to my main board IC's  network connectivity and power capacity.  
handsent mainly we call it the     $'mother_board /main board'.$
Of combination of    Multiple Sister_board =/< in a Single Main_board

Motherboard can be a combination of verious boards in a single Space / Board . with intigrated IC and logic-Gates with mathematical Calculation of electricity supply inside the main board and it's Connectivity.  
I mean Mother_Board is a place of multiple complete module's place of paradise in short space. Actually the purpose of my Article is to make thing go on.. Or help our Upcoming generating evolve more advance than we are now.
As we understand    $'main board' and 'mother board'$
All boards are   $ = or â‰  $ same thing but could be some combination of multiple board in one place. 

I am making thing long and boring for understand in Future	$"what is 'Network' Between sim IC to handset IC "connectivity".$


Now the lets Focus on my android app im trying to Monitoring. 
First the App checked capacity of my Sim card data capture speed and my main_board data capture speed along with data capacity limit (the electricity)
	$ {Android Sub System Linux [Emulated (Electricity Supply)]} $


    $ So, networking is pretty wird!..$

After all,
Handset board capacity is 5G now day but we still have majority of device network IC capacity is 811 MBPS which is too high to resis from short cercuit if we try to use it's full potential (or overclocing)

Ok,  so our device manufacturers technically lie but its not a lie.  

Because if we make a cercuit IC with proper circuit board resistors	${[for servive or resist longer than] < real time ] || (example: minimum 1 years maximum 10-20 years)]} $.. Yap we already have all the future tech available on planet. 
But for the technologycal limitation and Security barier, our system/society dosent allow much privilege or access to front end users along with developers 


Using super conductive mother_board cpasitor or IC.   We can build a super handset or a Computing_Machine at present day. Which will be far more advanced and Futuristic to current general users on the Globe . Practically the combination of proper Cercuitry, are Capable of doing anything . Observing Networking between everything would be so fascinating on these Gadgates, It's fast and highly resistance on_board .  

But challange is to making some powerful resistor, switching circuitry in a very tinny place.  I mean, for make a IC , we have to make it very very little place like inside in a nano centimetres space. Or In public language_  i can say, a tinny chip in a mobile cercuit board in a very short space resistend from short cercuit with each other during Power Circulation.  All though we have now PCI board like technology which is also Amezing and a lot-lot-lot to discover yet.  "Alas! It is nothing if u dont know everything @_@  ðŸ¤ª  "

But making things tinny is not enough till untill infinity which is not discovered yet  [Don't fall in Paradox] ........

	${ I didn't wanted to disappoint you guys ðŸ˜ž . But everything is possible â™¤ }$


So i guess this content is not that improper for modern day's hackers but a true shinny inspiration for modern day's 'Dremer Developer' like us from True Developers Family. 

	$Hell ya Devepolers.....$

For hacker like Network Engineers; Isn't the 'Everything Hacking' just a piece of cake?
